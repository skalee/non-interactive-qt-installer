This repository contains a collection of scripts which automate Qt installation
from official unified online installers.  It is designed with CI/CD services
in mind, and tested in Travis CI.

Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems are supported.  Note that GUI capabilities are
required -- it's just an automation script, which iterates through install
wizard screens.  That implies that X Window System is needed to run the script
on Linux.  Xvfb should do the trick on headless servers (see `.travis.yml`).

== Usage

Tip: Use `.travis.yml` as an example.

=== Step 1: Choosing online installer

Decide which online installer should be used.  They all are listed here:
{online_installers}.

=== Step 2: Finding Updates.xml

Obtain identifiers of components which will be installed.  The easiest way to do
so is to seek them in proper `Updates.xml` file, which is located at URL like:

----
https://download.qt.io/online/qtsdkrepository/(installer_platform)/desktop/qt5_(version)/Updates.xml
----

Because of odd naming format, it is suggested to crawl subdirectories starting
from {qtsdkrepository}.

For example, for Windows installer and Qt 5.12.3, respective `Updates.xml` is
located at {updates_win_5123}.  Note that `windows_x86` here is matching
the installer name (`qt-unified-windows-x86-online.exe`), not necessarily
the target platform architecture -- this file describes packages for x64
platforms as well.

=== Step 3: Finding package identifiers

The `Updates.xml` files contain identifiers of all packages that online
installers can handle.

For example, in order to install Qt 5.12.3 on Windows for MSVC 2017 64-bit
compiler, the appropriate identifier is `qt.qt5.5123.win64_msvc2017_64`,
as it is defined in {updates_win_5123}.  And for Qt WebEngine package,
the identifier is `qt.qt5.5123.qtwebengine`.  Note that there is also a package
`qt.qt5.5123.qtwebengine.win64_msvc2017_64` -- you should skip it, as well as
any other package which has a non-empty `<AutoDependOn>` element.  These are
selected automatically, depending on your other choices.

=== Step 4: Creating configuration script

Having learned package identifiers, create a configuration file, which in fact
is a piece of JavaScript with two global variable definitions:
`InstallComponents` with a list of package identifiers and `InstallPath` with
installation path.  For example:

[source,javascript]
----
var InstallComponents = [
    "qt.qt5.5123.win64_msvc2017_64",
    "qt.qt5.5123.qtwebengine"
];

var InstallPath = "C:\\Qt";
----

=== Step 5: Running the script

[source,bash]
----
# Online installer file name (from step 1)
export QT_INSTALLER_DOWNLOAD_NAME="qt-unified-windows-x86-online.exe"
# Absolute path to configuration file (from step 4)
export QT_INSTALLER_VARS="/absolute/path/to/configuration/script.js"

./qt_installer.sh
----

== TODO

* Handle Archived/LTS/Preview releases in online installer (possibly difficult).
* Handle offline installers.
* Rewrite in PowerShell, which is available on all target platforms (Windows,
  Linux, MacOS) without much hassle.
